## Setup
All code is implemented in [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/).

First [install PyTorch, torchvision, and CUDA](http://pytorch.org/), then
update / install the following packages:

(with Conda and Python 2.7 on Linux the instructions [here](http://pytorch.org/) will look something like)
```bash
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
```

### (Optional) GPU Acceleration

If you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can accelerate all operations with CUDA.

First [install CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

### (Optional) cuDNN

When using CUDA, you can use cuDNN to accelerate convolutions.

First [download cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) and copy the libraries to `/usr/local/cuda/lib64/`. 


### Pretrained CNN Models

<div align='center'>
  <img src='images/fig_cnn.png' height="225px">
</div>

Download all pretrained CNN models from Google Drive by running the script

```bash
bash models/download_CNN_models.sh
```

<!-- This will download ten model files (~200MB) to the folder `models/`.
 -->

## Download ImageNet CLS-LOC

<div align='center'>
  <img src='images/imagenet_logo.jpg' height="40px">
</div>

First,[register and create an ImageNet account.](http://image-net.org/download-images)

Next, download the 1.28 Million images

Now, we need to download the bounding box annotations, either [via the link here](http://image-net.org/Annotation/Annotation.tar.gz) (42.8 MB in size).
or via command line
```bash
wget http://image-net.org/Annotation/Annotation.tar.gz
```
They are stored in recursive tar.gz files, which can be recursively unzipped via tar, which will take around 10 minutes
```bash
tar -xvzf
mkdir bbox_annotation
tar -xvzf Annotation.tar.gz -C bbox_annotation
rm Annotation.tar.gz
cd bbox_annotation
for a in `ls -1 *.tar.gz`; do gzip -dc $a | tar xf -; done
rm *.tar.gz
```

Now, we have a directory called "bbox_annotation/Annotation" that contains .xml files with bounding box information for 3727 classes ("synsets") of ImageNet. We will use only the 1000 featured for the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognitiion Challenge (ILSVRC) task.

At this point, we'll arrange the image data into three folders: "train", "val", and "test".

6.3G val.zip
56G train.zip

On the ILSVRC 2016 page on the ImageNet website, find and download the file named
```bash
ILSVRC2016_CLS-LOC.tar.gz
```
This is the Classification-Localization dataset (155GB),unchanged since ILSVRC2012. There are a total of 1,281,167 images for training. The number of images for each synset (category) ranges from 732 to 1300. There are 50,000 validation images, with 50 images per synset. There are 100,000 test images. All images are in JPEG format.

It is arranged as follows: {split}/{synset_name}/{file_name}.JPEG 

For example, ImageNet_2012/train/n02500267/02500267_2597.JPEG

We will use the bounding box subset of the images from CLS-LOC (that have bounding box information). We'll then use subsets of the images with annotated bounding boxes to evaluate sample efficiency. Run:
```bash
mkdir ImageNetLocalization
python cnns/imagenet/create_bbox_dataset.py
python cnns/imagenet/create_imagenet_test_set.py
```


<!-- ## Models from the paper
The style transfer models we used in the paper will be located in the folder `models/cvpr18`.
Here are some example results where we use these models to stylize this
image of the Chicago skyline with at an image size of 512:

## Training CNN Models From Scratch

The script `train.py` lets you train a new CNN model from scratch.

```bash
python cnns/train/train.py
```

By default this script runs on GPU; to run on CPU, remove the .cuda() lines within the code.

<!-- The full set of options for this script is [described here](doc/flags.md#fast_neural_stylelua).
 -->

<!-- ## Webcam demo
You can use the script `webcam_demo.lua` to run one or more models in real-time
off a webcam stream. To run this demo you need to use `qlua` instead of `th`:

```bash
qlua webcam_demo.lua -models models/instance_norm/candy.t7 -gpu 0
```

You can run multiple models at the same time by passing a comma-separated list
to the `-models` flag:

```bash
qlua webcam_demo.lua \
  -models models/instance_norm/candy.t7,models/instance_norm/udnie.t7 \
  -gpu 0
```

With a Pascal Titan X you can easily run four models in realtime at 640x480:

<div align='center'>
  <img src='images/webcam.gif' width='700px'>
</div>

The webcam demo depends on a few extra Lua packages:
- [clementfarabet/lua---camera](https://github.com/clementfarabet/lua---camera)
- [torch/qtlua](https://github.com/torch/qtlua)

You can install / update these packages by running:

```bash
luarocks install camera
luarocks install qtlua
```

The full set of options for this script is [described here](doc/flags.md#webcam_demolua).


## Training new models

You can [find instructions for training new models here](doc/training.md).

## Optimization-based Style Transfer

The script `slow_neural_style.lua` is similar to the
[original neural-style](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style), and uses
the optimization-based style-transfer method described by Gatys et al.

This script uses the same code for computing losses as the feedforward training
script, allowing for fair comparisons between feedforward style transfer networks
and optimization-based style transfer.

Compared to the original [neural-style](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style),
this script has the following improvements:

- Remove dependency on protobuf and [loadcaffe](https://github.com/szagoruyko/loadcaffe)
- Support for many more CNN architectures, including ResNets

The full set of options for this script is [described here](doc/flags.md#slow_neural_stylelua).
